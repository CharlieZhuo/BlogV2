# How to create Table of content component in React

## What i am hoping to achieve:

A Table of Content component that generate a blog page content's catalog based on HTML elements(Mostly `<H1>` to `<H6>`) tree .

1. Generated table should have tree like data structure,Each tree node corresponds to an html element and has its children nodes.
2. Clicking on a table item should resulted in page scrolling to html element.
3. It should be aware of page's current scroll position, and highlights the item that contain scroll position.
4. We should be able to style it freely

## My initial solution

Since i am using mdx as blog file format,and `@mdx-js` package support plugins from remark and rehype(See the [Architecture](https://mdxjs.com/packages/mdx/#architecture) of @mdx-js).

[remark-toc](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-toc) was my initial thought. It use mdast-util-toc under the hood to generate toc from markdown's abstract syntax tree.
The generated toc at specific location will also be markdown.
It's commonnly used for generating toc for Github readme page.

However,it comes with some limitation as I can't achieve target 3 and 4 easily. I would perfer table of content to be a React component instead of plain html generated from markdown.

## Next solution found

Trough some online searching, I found the common way to implement table of content is through [DOM api](https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-CN/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction#dom_interfaces).

### Get elements

You get elements that you want to use as item in TOC from `Document.querySelectorAll(selectorString)`.
`selectorString` is the css selector for target elements.
For example, to get all `<H1>` to `<H6>` elements, use

```
const result = Array.from(
        document.querySelectorAll("H1,H2,H3,H4,H5,H6")
      );
```

### Generate Table of Content from result elements

### implement detection of scroll position
